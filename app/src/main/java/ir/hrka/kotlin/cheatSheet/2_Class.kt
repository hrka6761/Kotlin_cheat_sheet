/**
 * * A class in Kotlin can have only one primary constructor and one or more secondary constructors.
 * * Members of a class is final by default and must be open to overriding (an open member can not be private).
 * * If a class has a primary constructor, secondary constructors must be invoke primary constructor:
 *   * directly or indirectly by calling another secondary constructor that the primary constructor calls.
 * * A class is public and final and with a public zero-param constructor by default.
 * * During the initialization of an instance, the initializer blocks are executed in the same order
 * as they appear in the class body, interleaved with the property initializers.
 * * Initialization block codes convert to constructor in java after decompile.
 * * Members that declared in the companion object block must be called by the class name without instantiating.
 * * Class members can access the private members of the corresponding companion object.
 * * After decompile in java create static final class Companion and member function of companion object
 * is declared in it and member property of companion object is declared as static final property.
