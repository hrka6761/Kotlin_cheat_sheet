/**
 * * Interface is open and public by default.
 * * An interface cannot contain any constructor.
 * * We cannot instantiate from an Interface directly.
 * * An interface can derive from other interfaces.
 * * What makes them different from abstract classes is that interfaces cannot store state.
 * * Properties declared in interfaces can't have backing fields,
 * and therefore accessors declared in interfaces can't reference them.
 * * A property declared in an interface can either be abstract or provide implementations for accessors.
 * * Interface can't have properties with initializers because it cannot have state.
 * * Interface can contains abstract and concrete methods.
 * * Concrete member is open by default.
 * * We can't use `final` keyword in an interface.
