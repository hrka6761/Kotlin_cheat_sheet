/**
 * * Sealed classes and interfaces provide controlled inheritance of a class hierarchies.
 * * All direct subclasses of a sealed class are known at compile time.
 * * A sealed class itself is always an abstract class,
 * and as a result, can't be instantiated directly.
 * * Each enum constant exists only as a single instance,
 * while subclasses of a sealed class may have multiple instances.
 * * Constructors of sealed classes can have one of two visibilities:
 *    * Protected (by default)
 *    * Private
 * * We can override function of interface that implemented by sealed class,
 * can be implemented in every sub class or by own sealed class.
 * * Sealed class can contain abstract member that must be implemented by all instances.
 * * A sealed interface can be derived from another interface then sub classes must be implemented its members.
 * * When you combine sealed classes or interfaces with the when expression,
 * you can cover the behavior of all possible subclasses and ensure that no new subclasses
 * are created to affect your code adversely (you don't need to add an else clause).
