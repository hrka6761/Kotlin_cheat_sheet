/**
 * * We declare a `package` at the top of your Kotlin file using the package keyword:
 *    * Use all lowercase letters.
 *    * Use reverse domain name notation to ensure uniqueness.
 *    * Avoid using reserved words or special characters.
 * ```
 * package com.google.kotlin
 * ```
 * * When we want to use another file or class in our class,
 * we must `import` its package name in our class unless it is in the same package.
 * * We can declare value by `val` that is immutable:
 *    * It equals final variable in java.
 *    * It only has getter.
 *    * It is thread safety.
 *    * It is more memory-efficient.
 * * We can declare variable by `var` that is mutable:
 *    * It equals regular variable in java.
 *    * It has getter and setter.
 * * Compile-time constants `const val`:
 *    * It must be a top-level property, or a member of an object declaration or a companion object.
 *    * It must be initialized with a value of type String or a primitive type.
 *    * It cannot be a custom getter.
 * * The compiler will inline usages of the constant, replacing the reference to the constant with its actual value.
 * However, the field will not be removed and therefore can be interacted with using reflection.
 * * Use `val` wherever possible.
 * * Use `var` when necessary.
 * * You can define custom accessors for a property:
 *    * If you define a custom getter, it will be called every time you access the property.
 *    * If you define a custom setter, it will be called every time you assign a value to the property, except its initialization.
 * * A `field` is only used as a part of a property to hold its value in memory
 * (Fields cannot be declared directly and Kotlin provides it).
 * * The field identifier can only be used in the accessors of the property.
 * * A backing field will be generated for a property if it uses the default implementation of at least one of the accessors,
 * or if a custom accessor references it through the field identifier.
 * * `Unit` is an object that oly have a method (toString).
 * * `Any` is parent of all classes in kotlin
 * (directly when the class is not derived from any class and indirect when the class is derived from a class).
 * * `Nothing` is a regular class that has not any instance because its constructor is private
 * (if a function has the return type of Nothing, it means that it never returns (always throws an exception)).
 * * In the following cases if person.name = null s is Nothing:
 * ```
 * val s = person.name ?: return
 * val s = person.name ?: throw NullPointerException()
 * ```
 * * `TODO()` return Nothing and throws exception.
 * it is a standard function of kotlin that is used in the body of functions that is not implemented yet
 * (we can pass it a string as a reason.).
 * * Late-initialized properties and variables `lateinit var`:
 *    * This modifier can be used on var properties declared inside the body of a class.
 *    * You can not declare primitive types by late init (only reference types such String or etc).
 *    * It is not allowed on properties with a custom getter or setter.
 *    * It is not allowed on properties of nullable types.

/**
 * * In Kotlin, everything is an object.
 * * Numbers are stored as primitive types:
 *    * Except when you create a nullable number reference such as Int?.
 *    * Except when you use generics.
 * * JVM applies the memory optimization to Integers between -128 and 127:
 * ```
 * val a: Int = 100
 * val boxedA: Int? = a
 * val anotherBoxedA: Int? = a
 * println(boxedA === anotherBoxedA) // true
 * ```
 * * Unsigned integer is declared to as int in the java.
 * * All integer and decimal types are number and extend it and comparable class.
 * * To perform a runtime check use `is` and `!is` operators.
 * * Smart casts occurred after using `is` and `!is` operators in a control flow like `if` and `when`.
 * * To cast, you must use `as` operator.
 * * To safe casting on nullable use `as?`:
 * ```
 * val x: String? = y as String?
 * // if y=null x=null , if y is not a string throw ClassCastException.
 * val x: String? = y as? String
 * // if y=null or is not a string x=null.
 * ```
 * * `return`: by default returns from the nearest enclosing function or anonymous function.
 * * `break`: terminates the nearest enclosing loop.
 * * `continue`: proceeds to the next step of the nearest enclosing loop.
 * * There is not any checked exception in kotlin.
 * * To handling exceptions, we can use try-catch-finally blocks.
 * * To explicit throw exception by function use `@Throws` annotation.

/**
 * * There are four visibility modifiers in Kotlin: `private`, `protected`, `internal`, `public`.
 * * `private` means that the member is visible inside class or file only.
 * * `protected` means that the member has the same visibility as one marked as private, but that it is also visible in subclasses.
 * * `internal` means that any client inside this module who sees the declaring class sees its internal members(a module is a set of Kotlin files compiled together).
 * * `public` means that any client who sees the declaring class sees its public members.
 * * If you don't use a visibility modifier, public is used by default.
 * * The protected modifier is not available for top-level declarations.
 * * When we declare a class private, we cannot inherit from it anywhere except in the same file or class.
 * * When we declare a class private, we can only inherit from it when the subClass is internal or private.
