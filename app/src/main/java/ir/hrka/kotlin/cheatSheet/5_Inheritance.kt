/**
 * * All classes in Kotlin have a common superclass, `Any`,
 * which is the default superclass for a class with no supertypes declared.
 * * Each class can only derive from one class but can implement multiple interfaces.
 * * By default, Kotlin classes are final.
 * * By default, all members of Kotlin classes are final.
 * * We can use the override keyword as part of the property declaration in a primary constructor.
 * * We can use the override keyword as part of the property declaration in the body.
 * * We can also override a val property with a var property, but not vice versa.
 * * We can to prohibit re-overriding by using final.
 * * An overriding function is not allowed to specify default values for its parameters.
 * * We can't call companion members of superclass by the subclass.
 * * If there is no open modifier on a function,
 * declaring a method with the same signature in a subclass is not allowed,
 * either with override or without it.
 * * Code in a subclass can call its superclass functions and property accessor implementations
 * using the super keyword.
 * * Inside an inner class, accessing the superclass of the outer class.
 * is done using the `super` keyword qualified with the outer class name like `super@Outer`.
 * * During the construction of a new instance of a derived class,
 * the base class initialization is done as the first step.
 * * If a same function is declared in the both super class and interface,
 * (or a same concrete function into two interface) must be implemented in sub class.
 * * To denote the supertype from which the inherited implementation is taken,
 * use super qualified by the supertype name in angle brackets.
 * * In the subclass, we cannot reduce the access level of the member but we can increase:
 *    * if it public in super class, we cannot reduce to protected or private.
